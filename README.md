<h1>Fading Memories</h1>
<h3>As we move on with our lives our past memories become distant and the speed in which we forget, reminds us to cherish every moment...<h3>
<p>This project symbolizes our memories and that with passing time our memories will be forgotten. The clock that you stand on represents time. This time is cruel, ruthless, and impatient; we can never have enough. As long as time moves, our memories will spiral into a void of what's to be forgotten. The progressive blurring of the image symbolizes time also as fog slowly consuming our memories until it is just a blur.</p>
